* Consider listening to [The Habitat](https://www.gimletmedia.com/the-habitat)
  Podcast with your child.
  It's 7 entertaining episodes documenting the NASA HI-SEAS mission
  studying a small group of people taking part in a simulated visit to
  Mars. Many of the problems that were encountered may provide the kids
  with good ideas for the Into Orbit Challenge. **Note however** that there
  is definitely adult language and situations so use your
  judgment on the suitability of the content for your child.
